# Understanding-flight-delays-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
**Objective**

The objective of this project is two-fold. First, we aim to analyse the factors that lead to delay in passenger
aircraft. As a part of this analysis, we will also investigate the effect a flight delay at a particular date and time
has on subsequent delays, and under what conditions a flight delay can cause a chain reaction of delays that
follows.
As the second phase of the project, we will build a model that predicts the arrival delay for a given scheduled
flight. Through the analysis that we will perform in the first phase of the project, we aim to create a rich set of
features that will help us predict flight delays. We also hope to attain valuable insights from the analysis, which
will help us in picking the kind of prediction model that will be appropriate for our task.
**Datasets**

1. Detailed Statistics Departures dataset, https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Departures.aspx
2. OpenSky Aircraft Database, https://opensky-network.org/datasets/metadata/
3. Iowa Environmental Mesonet https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/
**Data Analysis**

Here we tried plotting routes on the US map for different delay causes. In comparison to the lighter coloured
routes, lines drawn with a stronger hue(shade) depict routes with larger percentages of delays.
